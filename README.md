This is the case study of fibonacci retracement and triple average moving .

I combined Fibonacci Retracement and Triple Moving Average Strategy
together. Different from the implemented Fibonacci Retracement trading strategy only. Triple Moving Average can be used as an identified trend before entry or exit toincrease the performance of trading. The indicators are integrated into this trading strategy:
Fibonacci Levels indicator and Simple Moving Average(SMA) which is new
for our group and ATR (Average True Range) as a cut loss indicator.
The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a technical indicator that can be used to
determine whether an asset's price will continue or reverse a bull or bear trend. It calculates the
average of a range of prices over a specified number of periods, which is known as the
'lookback' period. 

Fibonacci Level is used to determine the potential supported line or resistance line,
whatever up or down trend. This method utilizes the Fibonacci ratios to identify key price levels
where markets tend to experience temporary reversals before resuming their original trend.
This method takes the difference of two extreme points from historical price and multiples
Fibonacci ratios to get.

In this project, I've combined Fibonacci Retracement and Triple Simple Moving
Averages Strategy (TMA) to create a comprehensive trading strategy. The primary concept
behind this strategy is to use TMA for entry and exit signals, while Fibonacci retracement levels
help determine the optimal price points for entry and exit.
